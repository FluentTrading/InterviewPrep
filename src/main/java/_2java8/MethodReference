Method references are a special type of lambda expressions.
They're often used to create simple lambda expressions by referencing existing methods.

There are four kinds of method references:

1. Static methods
list.forEach(  x -> System.out.println(x) )
can be changed to
list.forEach( System.out::println )

2. Instance method

3. Constructor
