Flyweight pattern is used to reduce the memory footprint. It is based on a factory which recycles created objects by storing them after creation.


private static Map<Color, Vehicle> vehiclesCache = new HashMap<>();

public static Vehicle createVehicle( Color color ){

    Vehicle newVehicle = vehiclesCache.computeIfAbsent(color, newColor -> {
        Engine newEngine = new Engine();
        return new Car(newEngine, newColor);
    });

    return newVehicle;
}
