Bits and Bytes:
Base 2 numbers (0, 1) are also called binary numbers.

In binary number, the most significant Bit (left most) bit is the sign bit.
If the MSB is 0, that means the number is positive.

Positive numbers
----------------
Positive numbers are stored just as simple binary numbers.
So number int 15, will be stored as 00000000 00000000 00000000 00001111 (32 bit number)

Positive numbers
----------------
Negative numbers are stored as:

a) Take the number, convert to binary and perform 1’s complement.
(In 1’s compliment, bits are flipped so, 0’s are changed to 1’s and 1’s are changed to 0’s.)
b) Add 1 to 1’s compliment.

Example:
Converting 10 to -10 using 2’s compliment.
10 -> 1010 (binary) -> 0101 (1s compliment) -> 0110 (2's compliment)

boolean: 	Represents one bit of information.
char: 		Represents single 16-bit Unicode character.
byte: 		Represents  8-bit signed two's complement integer.
Short: 		Represents 16-bit signed two's complement integer.
int: 		Represents 32-bit signed two's complement integer.
long:		Represents 64-bit signed two's complement integer.
float: 		Represents a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point.
double: 	Represents a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point.
